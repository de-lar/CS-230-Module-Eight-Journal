Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client inquired about a web-based version of the game "Draw It or Lose It".  The game needed to be designed to support multiple teams and players. IT also had to ensure there were always unique team names and an instance of the game in the memory. This was accomplished by creating a Java application with design patterns such as singleton and iterators.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I did well in the documentation was describe each characteristic of each operating system and their advantages and disadvantages.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Understanding the project requirements and constraints was helpful when designing the code because it helped ensure the code aligned with the client requirements and providing a reference point.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
It is important to implement users’ needs into the software design to ensure the final product aligns with the intended purpose of the game and to provide quality user experience. Taking input from user needs impacts functionality, usability, and user satisfaction. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the software design by performing analyzing and using techniques such as UML modeling and design patterns.
